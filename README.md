## Challenges

1. The songId wasn't being properly read from our API to the application
2. Ensuring naming conventions of the variables throughout the application were the same became very confusing very quickly.
3. Successfully running authorization and the favorited songs on the front-end and saving both data on the back-end became a very sensitive challenge as they both intermingled in naming conventions and overall functionality
4. Deploying application to Render

## Lessons Learned

1. Remaining patient and keeping a detailed eye goes a long way
2. Using GraphQL and MongoDB to address errors
3. Creating a MERN Stack application from scratch
4. Using MongoDB to debug server-side errors
5. Learned how to deploy to Render
6. Group-think to address errors is very powerful as every team member has different strengths
